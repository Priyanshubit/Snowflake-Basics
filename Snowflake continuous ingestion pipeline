ðŸ§Š Snowflake Data Pipeline with Snowpipe

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time data ingestion pipeline using Snowflake, AWS S3, and Snowpipe. 
The pipeline automatically ingests CSV files from an external S3 bucket into a Snowflake table for seamless analytics.


ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Data ingestion is often manual and time-consuming. To automate this process, we use Snowpipe to load patient registration data directly from AWS S3 into Snowflake in near real-time.
