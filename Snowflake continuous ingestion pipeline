üßä Snowflake Data Pipeline with Snowpipe

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time data ingestion pipeline using Snowflake, AWS S3, and Snowpipe. 
The pipeline automatically ingests CSV files from an external S3 bucket into a Snowflake table for seamless analytics.


üìå Problem Statement
Data ingestion is often manual and time-consuming. To automate this process, we use Snowpipe to load patient registration data directly from AWS S3 into Snowflake in near real-time.

1. Database Setup

USE DATABASE DATA_PIPELINE;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS PIPELINE;

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE PATIENTS(

  CITY VARCHAR(100),
  REGISTRATION INTEGER
