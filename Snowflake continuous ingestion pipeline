# ❄️⚡ Snowflake Data Pipeline with Snowpipe  

This project demonstrates how to build a **real-time data ingestion pipeline** using **Snowflake, AWS S3, and Snowpipe**.  
The pipeline automatically ingests **CSV files** from an external **S3 bucket** into a **Snowflake table** for seamless analytics.

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**  
Manual data ingestion is **slow** ⏳ and **error-prone** ❌.  
➡️ To solve this, we use **Snowpipe** to **auto-load patient registration data** from AWS S3 → Snowflake, in **near real-time** ⏱️.
